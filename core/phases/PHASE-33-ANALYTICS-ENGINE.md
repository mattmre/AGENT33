# Phase 33: Analytics Engine

## Overview
- **Phase**: 33 of 40
- **Category**: Analytics
- **Release Target**: TBD
- **Estimated Sprints**: TBD

## Objectives
- Define metrics and aggregation strategies.
- Ensure analytics are reproducible and validated.
- Provide export or visualization hooks.
- Focus: Metric definitions, aggregation, validation.

## Scope Outline
- Planning: confirm requirements, inputs/outputs, and success metrics.
- Implementation: build minimal, composable components and integration seams.
- Validation: create deterministic tests and fixtures, capture evidence.
- Documentation: add concise usage notes and examples.

## Deliverables
- Analytics data model and aggregation logic.
- Fixtures and metric calculation tests.
- Documentation for analytics configuration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Metrics match expected results on fixtures.
- [ ] Analytics outputs are deterministic.
- [ ] Aggregation logic is documented.

## Dependencies
- Phase 32

## Blocks
- Phase 34

## Orchestration Guidance
- Define metrics before implementation.
- Create representative datasets for tests.
- Measure performance at scale.

## Coding Direction
- Keep analytics pure and deterministic.
- Separate aggregation from presentation.
- Optimize for clarity first.

## Review Checklist
- [ ] Interfaces/contracts reviewed and approved.
- [ ] Tests/fixtures added with evidence.
- [ ] Documentation updated and verified.
- [ ] Scope remains within this phase only.
