# EVIDENCE.md (Policy Pack v1)

Purpose: Define minimum evidence required for any non-trivial change.

## Minimum Evidence

- Results (pass/fail + summary).
- Artifacts generated (reports, logs, outputs).
- Diff summary (files changed + rationale).

## Storage
- Link evidence in TASKS and verification logs.
- Capture review notes when risk triggers apply.
