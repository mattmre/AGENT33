## Executive Summary

Camunda 8 is a mature, enterprise-grade process orchestration platform built around the Zeebe workflow engine. Unlike AGENT-33's documentation-only approach, Camunda provides a complete runtime implementation with BPMN 2.0 and DMN standards. Their architecture emphasizes horizontal scalability, fault tolerance via append-only logs, and event-driven messaging patterns—concepts highly applicable to AGENT-33's orchestration specifications.

The repository demonstrates sophisticated operational patterns including backpressure management, four-pillar observability (logs, metrics, traces, profiles), CQRS-style read/write separation, and comprehensive testing pyramids. These patterns can inform AGENT-33's specification evolution without requiring implementation changes, aligning with the model-agnostic and evidence-first principles.

Key opportunities for AGENT-33 include adopting Camunda's event scope model for trigger management, implementing their backpressure/rate-limiting specifications, and adapting their BPMN-based visual workflow representation for documentation. Camunda's exporter architecture and connector patterns offer proven specifications for extensibility that could enhance AGENT-33's integration guidance.

## Feature Inventory

### Feature 1: Backpressure Management
**Description**: Configurable rate limiting with multiple algorithms (Vegas, AIMD, Gradient, Gradient2, Fixed) to prevent broker overload. Commands are dropped rather than buffered to maintain system stability.

**Application to AGENT-33**:
- Specify backpressure patterns for agent orchestration
- Define whitelisting rules (critical commands bypass limits)
- Document semaphore/concurrency limits in `parallel/SEMAPHORE_CONTROL.md`

**Implementation Pattern**:
```yaml
# orchestrator-backpressure.schema.json
backpressure:
  enabled: true
  algorithm: "vegas"  # vegas | aimd | fixed | gradient | gradient2
  useWindowed: true
  whitelist:
    - intent: "CANCEL"
    - intent: "COMPLETE"
    - intent: "FAIL"
```

**Priority**: High
**Effort**: Medium (2-3 days specification work)

**Application to AGENT-33**:
- Enhance `core/orchestrator/handoff/` with durable state patterns
- Specify snapshot/restore semantics
- Document recovery procedures

**Implementation Pattern**:
```markdown
## Durability Specification

### Append-Only Log

## Recommendations

### Recommendation 1: Adopt Four-Pillar Observability Model
**Rationale**: AGENT-33's analytics framework (CA-015) would benefit from Camunda's structured observability approach.

**Implementation**:
1. Create `core/orchestrator/analytics/OBSERVABILITY_PILLARS.md`
2. Extend `METRICS_CATALOG.md` with pillar categorization
3. Define trace schema in `core/schemas/trace.schema.json`

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "title": "AGENT-33 Trace Schema",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "traceId": { "type": "string", "format": "uuid" },
    "spanId": { "type": "string" },
    "parentSpanId": { "type": "string" },
    "operationName": { "type": "string" },
    "startTime": { "type": "string", "format": "date-time" },
    "duration": { "type": "integer" },
    "tags": { "type": "object" }
  }
}
```

---

### Recommendation 2: Implement Backpressure Specification
**Rationale**: AGENT-33's parallel execution (CA-008) needs rate limiting patterns for agent saturation scenarios.

**Implementation**:
1. Extend `core/orchestrator/parallel/SEMAPHORE_CONTROL.md` with backpressure section
2. Add algorithm specifications (Vegas, AIMD, Fixed)
3. Define whitelist patterns for critical operations

---

### Recommendation 3: Enhance Trigger Catalog with Event Scopes
**Rationale**: Camunda's event scope model provides rigorous semantics for trigger resolution.

**Implementation**:
1. Update `core/orchestrator/triggers/TRIGGER_CATALOG.md`
2. Add scope types: flow scope, event scope, boundary scope
3. Define interrupting vs. non-interrupting semantics

---

### Recommendation 4: Add Connector Specification Schema
**Rationale**: Standardize external system integration patterns.

**Implementation**:
1. Create `core/schemas/connector.schema.json`
2. Document connector registry in `core/api/CONNECTOR_REGISTRY.md`
3. Add example connectors (HTTP, message queue)

---

### Recommendation 5: Formalize Testing Pyramid in Rules
**Rationale**: Camunda's testing conventions (should... prefix, given/when/then) improve consistency.

**Implementation**:
1. Update `core/packs/policy-pack-v1/rules/testing.md`
2. Add reliability testing section
3. Include Awaitility-style async assertion patterns

---

### Recommendation 6: Protocol Versioning for Schema Evolution
**Rationale**: AGENT-33 schemas (CA-010) need evolution strategy documentation.

**Implementation**:
1. Create `core/schemas/VERSION_NEGOTIATION.md`
2. Define compatibility rules (backward, forward)
3. Document migration procedures

---

### Recommendation 7: Exporter Pattern for Audit Trail
**Rationale**: Aligns with AGENT-33's evidence-first principle and auditability requirement.

**Implementation**:
1. Create `core/orchestrator/exporters/README.md`
2. Define exporter interface specification
3. Add position management patterns

---

### Recommendation 8: Dynamic Configuration Hot-Reload
**Rationale**: Operational flexibility for production orchestration.

**Implementation**:
1. Extend `core/orchestrator/modes/` with `HOT_RELOAD_SPEC.md`
2. Categorize configs by reload capability
3. Define validation and rollback procedures
