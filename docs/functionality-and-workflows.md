# Functionality and Workflows

This is the current behavior map for AGENT-33 on `main` as of February 15, 2026.

## 1. Runtime Architecture

Primary entry point:
- `engine/src/agent33/main.py`

Startup wiring initializes:
- PostgreSQL-backed `LongTermMemory`
- Redis client
- NATS bus
- Agent registry from `engine/agent-definitions`
- Model router + embedding provider/cache
- BM25 index + hybrid searcher + RAG pipeline
- Progressive recall
- Skill registry + skill injector
- Code executor bridge for workflow `execute-code` action

Routers mounted:
- Health, chat, agents, workflows, auth, webhooks, dashboard, memory, reviews, traces, evaluations, autonomy, releases, improvements, training

## 2. Capability Inventory

| Domain | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chat completions | Operational | `/v1/chat/completions` proxies to Ollama with injection scan |
| Agent registry + invoke | Operational | Registry discovery from JSON definitions; invoke supports skills + progressive recall injection |
| Workflow engine | Operational | Sequential/parallel/dependency-aware modes; 8 step actions (`invoke-agent`, `run-command`, `validate`, `transform`, `conditional`, `parallel-group`, `wait`, `execute-code`) |
| Memory + RAG | Operational | Vector + hybrid retrieval; progressive recall levels |
| Tool framework | Partial | Tool registry/governance exists, but full runtime bootstrap is not fully wired in `main.py` |
| Code execution layer | Partial | `CodeExecutor` wired, but starts with `tool_registry=None`; adapters must be registered explicitly |
| Review automation | Operational | In-memory two-layer signoff lifecycle |
| Trace + failure pipeline | Operational | In-memory trace collector and failure records |
| Evaluation + regression gates | Operational | In-memory evaluation runs, baselines, regression recorder |
| Autonomy budgets | Operational | In-memory budgets, preflight, runtime enforcement, escalations |
| Release automation | Operational | In-memory release lifecycle, sync rules/executions, rollback records |
| Improvement operations | Operational | In-memory intake, lessons, checklists, metrics, roadmap refresh |
| Messaging webhooks | Partial | Routes exist; adapters must be registered explicitly |
| Training APIs | Partial | Routes exist; default startup only initializes `training_store`, not full runner/optimizer wiring |

## 3. Persistence Boundaries

Persistent (database/backing service):
- `memory_records` via `LongTermMemory` (PostgreSQL + pgvector)
- Training store tables (when `training_enabled` and initialized)
- Redis ephemeral cache/state
- NATS event transport

In-memory only (lost on restart):
- Workflow registry (`api/routes/workflows.py`)
- Review records (`review/service.py`)
- Trace/failure records (`observability/trace_collector.py`)
- Evaluation runs/baselines/regressions (`evaluation/service.py` + recorder)
- Autonomy budgets/enforcers/escalations (`autonomy/service.py`)
- Release records/sync/rollback state (`release/service.py`)
- Improvement intakes/lessons/metrics/checklists/refreshes (`improvement/service.py`)
- Auth users and API keys (`api/routes/auth.py`, `security/auth.py`)

## 4. Workflow Lifecycles

### 4.1 Review Lifecycle

States:
- `draft -> ready -> l1-review -> l1-approved -> (optional l2-review -> l2-approved) -> approved -> merged`

Main APIs:
- `/v1/reviews/{id}/assess`
- `/v1/reviews/{id}/assign-l1`
- `/v1/reviews/{id}/l1`
- `/v1/reviews/{id}/assign-l2`
- `/v1/reviews/{id}/l2`
- `/v1/reviews/{id}/approve`
- `/v1/reviews/{id}/merge`

### 4.2 Release Lifecycle

States:
- `planned -> frozen -> rc -> validating -> released`
- Failure/rollback branches: `failed`, `rolled_back`

Main APIs:
- `/v1/releases/{id}/freeze`
- `/v1/releases/{id}/rc`
- `/v1/releases/{id}/validate`
- `/v1/releases/{id}/publish`
- `/v1/releases/{id}/rollback`

### 4.3 Evaluation Lifecycle

Flow:
1. Create run (`/v1/evaluations/runs`)
2. Submit task results (`/runs/{id}/results`)
3. Compute metrics + gate report
4. Save baseline (`/runs/{id}/baseline`)
5. Triage/resolve regressions

### 4.4 Autonomy Budget Lifecycle

States:
- `draft -> pending_approval -> active -> suspended|expired|completed`

Flow:
1. Create budget
2. Activate or transition
3. Run preflight checks
4. Create enforcer
5. Evaluate command/file/network requests
6. Track escalations

### 4.5 Improvement Lifecycle

Research intake states:
- `submitted -> triaged -> analyzing -> accepted|deferred|rejected -> tracked`

Associated loops:
- Lesson capture and verification
- Periodic checklist completion
- Metrics snapshots and trend reporting
- Roadmap refresh records

### 4.6 Trace Lifecycle

States:
- `running -> completed|failed|cancelled`

Flow:
1. Start trace
2. Add step actions
3. Record failures if present
4. Complete trace

## 5. Known Integration Gaps

- `SessionSummarizer` is exposed via `session_summarizer_class` in startup, but `memory_search.summarize_session` expects `app.state.session_summarizer`.
- `ObservationCapture` is created without long-term memory/embedder bindings by default.
- Tool registry/governance exists but is not fully attached as an app-wide execution path during startup.
- Messaging adapters are not auto-registered in `webhooks._adapters` by default.
- Training routes expect `training_runner` and `agent_optimizer`; default startup only guarantees `training_store` when enabled.
- CLI `agent33 run` targets a legacy path (`/api/v1/workflows/run`) while workflow execution API is `/v1/workflows/{name}/execute`.

## 6. Pending and In-Progress Capabilities

The project is under active development, and some capabilities may be in progress on feature branches. This document reflects the current operational runtime on the active branch.
