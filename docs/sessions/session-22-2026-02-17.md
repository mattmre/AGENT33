# Session 22 — PR Coverage Audit and Next-Session Preparation

**Date**: 2026-02-17  
**Goal**: Ensure all completed work is represented by open PRs, then refresh handoff docs for clean continuation  
**Branch**: `phase25-visual-explainer-integration`

## Summary

Verified PR coverage and updated session handoff artifacts.  
No additional local implementation work was found outside open PR branches.

## Checks Performed

1. Audited local git state:
   - clean working tree before docs refresh
   - branch tracking status reviewed
2. Audited open PR state:
   - PR #26 (`docs/phase22-closure-refresh`)
   - PR #27 (`phase25-visual-explainer-integration`)
3. Confirmed no extra uncommitted/untracked code requiring a new PR.

## Actions Taken

1. Updated `docs/next-session.md` to current repo state:
   - removed stale pre-merge Phase 22 references
   - added current open PR list (#26, #27)
   - added prioritized next-session execution plan
2. Added this session log for traceability.
3. Updated session workspace plan (`plan.md`) with the new Phase 25 request outcome.

## Current Open PRs

- [#26](https://github.com/mattmre/AGENT33/pull/26) — docs: Phase 22 closure refresh and archive handoff
- [#27](https://github.com/mattmre/AGENT33/pull/27) — docs: add Phase 25 visual-explainer integration plan

## Recommended Next Actions

1. Merge PR #26, then PR #27.
2. After PR #27 merge, create a new implementation branch for Phase 25 Stage 1 (workflow DAG visualization MVP).
3. Re-run baseline backend/frontend checks before Phase 25 implementation.
