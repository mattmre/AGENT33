# Session 26 — PR #28 Review, Merge, and Handoff Refresh

**Date**: 2026-02-17  
**Goal**: Review open PR comments, apply/verify required fixes, merge Phase 25 PR to main, and refresh next-session handoff docs  
**Branch**: `main` (execution), `docs/session-26-handoff` (docs handoff updates)  
**PR**: [#28](https://github.com/mattmre/AGENT33/pull/28) (merged)

## Summary

Completed a full PR comment audit and verification cycle for Phase 25 PR #28, confirmed no unresolved actionable requests, posted validation status, merged to main, and updated handoff artifacts for the next session.

## Checks Performed

1. Reviewed open PR comments, review threads, and reviews for PR #28.
2. Confirmed unresolved review threads count was zero.
3. Verified repository state before/after merge.
4. Checked merge constraints and failing checks to separate baseline issues from PR-specific regressions.

## Actions Completed

1. **PR comment/review audit**
   - No actionable unresolved comments or change requests were present.
2. **Validation rerun on PR branch**
   - Backend lint: `python -m ruff check src tests` -> pass
   - Backend tests: `python -m pytest tests -q` -> `1557 passed, 1 warning`
   - Frontend validation: `npm run lint`, `npm run test -- --run`, `npm run build` -> pass
3. **PR communication**
   - Posted update comment: https://github.com/mattmre/AGENT33/pull/28#issuecomment-3914372837
4. **Merge execution**
   - Merged PR #28 to `main` with merge commit `d39180c06a49ba0fa24dd576ec0fe63f3c3bd9fd`
   - Deleted feature branch `phase25-workflow-graph-mvp` (local and remote)
5. **Handoff refresh**
   - Updated `docs/next-session.md`
   - Added this session log
   - Updated session workspace plan for continuity

## Baseline Findings

- PR #28 merge was blocked by required checks unrelated to the incremental PR diff:
  1. CI lint job failing on existing Ruff `UP042` enum modernization violations
  2. Security container scan failing on high-severity Python dependency CVEs
- These should be handled in a dedicated baseline remediation PR before broader feature work.

## Key Artifacts

- `docs/sessions/session-26-2026-02-17.md`
- `docs/next-session.md`
- Merge commit: `d39180c06a49ba0fa24dd576ec0fe63f3c3bd9fd`
- PR update comment: `issuecomment-3914372837`

## Validation Evidence

- `git status --short --branch` -> clean on `main` after merge
- `gh pr view 28 --json state,mergedAt,mergeCommit` -> merged
- Engine and frontend validation commands passed as listed above
- `python -m mypy src` remains baseline-failing in repository and was not modified in this session

## Next Steps

1. Open and merge a docs-only PR from `docs/session-26-handoff` for session handoff updates.
2. Create baseline remediation PR for CI lint (`UP042`) and container-scan CVEs.
3. Start Phase 26 Stage 1 implementation from updated `main` after remediation work is merged.
