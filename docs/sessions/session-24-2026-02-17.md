# Session 24 — PR Coverage Recheck and Next-Session Prep

**Date**: 2026-02-17  
**Goal**: Ensure all current work is represented in an open PR, then refresh session handoff artifacts  
**Branch**: `phase25-visual-explainer-integration`

## Summary

Performed another PR coverage audit and confirmed there is no additional local implementation work outside active PR branches. Updated session/next-session docs and prepared continuation guidance.

## Checks Performed

1. Verified branch and working tree status.
2. Listed open PRs and mapped current work to PR branches.
3. Confirmed no extra uncommitted implementation requiring a new PR.

## PR Coverage Result

- Open PRs:
  - [#26](https://github.com/mattmre/AGENT33/pull/26) — Phase 22 closure/handoff docs
  - [#27](https://github.com/mattmre/AGENT33/pull/27) — Phase 25+26 visual-explainer planning docs
- Conclusion: No separate new PR needed; updates belong on existing PR #27 branch.

## Actions Taken

1. Updated `docs/next-session.md` with Session 24 state and latest handoff pointer.
2. Added this session log for traceability.
3. Updated session workspace plan (`plan.md`) with current progress and next steps.

## Recommended Next Actions

1. Merge PR #26 then PR #27.
2. Create a fresh implementation branch from updated `main` for Phase 25 Stage 1.
3. Begin Phase 25 implementation while drafting Phase 26 contracts in parallel.
