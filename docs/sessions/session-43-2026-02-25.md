# Session 43 — Post-Merge Closeout (Baseline Stack + Phase 35 Wave 1)

**Date**: 2026-02-25  
**Focus/Goal**: Record post-merge closeout after baseline PRs (#67-#71) and Phase 35 Wave 1 PRs (#72-#74), including targeted validation evidence and forward priorities.

## Agent Orchestration Waves

- **Researcher wave**: confirmed merged-state continuity from baseline stack into Phase 35 Wave 1 connector-family boundaries.
- **Architect wave**: verified architectural intent held post-merge (centralized boundary governance, connector-family naming, staged rollout behavior).
- **Implementer wave**: executed targeted post-merge validation batches for baseline plus Wave 1 surfaces.
- **Documentation wave**: published post-merge updates in research/session/next-session docs.

## Merge Completion Summary

- Baseline stack merged in order: **#67, #68, #69, #70, #71**.
- Phase 35 Wave 1 merged in order: **#72, #73, #74**.
- Aggregate targeted validation result: **303 passed, 4 skipped**.

## Validation Evidence

```bash
cd engine && python -m pytest tests/test_phase30_effort_routing.py tests/test_phase31_learning_signals.py tests/test_phase32_connector_boundary.py tests/test_tool_loop.py tests/test_invoke_iterative.py tests/test_skill_matching.py tests/test_context_manager.py -q
# 213 passed, 1 skipped

cd engine && python -m pytest tests/test_connector_boundary_llm_memory.py tests/test_performance_fixes.py tests/test_phase32_connector_boundary.py -q
# 40 passed, 1 skipped

cd engine && python -m pytest tests/test_connector_boundary_multimodal_adapters.py tests/test_multimodal_api.py tests/test_phase32_connector_boundary.py -q
# 33 passed, 1 skipped

cd engine && python -m pytest tests/test_chat.py tests/test_phase32_connector_boundary.py -q
# 17 passed, 1 skipped
```

## Next Steps

1. Start Phase 35 Wave 2 planning for remaining non-boundary connector surfaces.
2. Track multimodal async-governance convergence as a scoped follow-up once async readiness is established.
3. Keep the four-batch targeted validation set as the regression smoke baseline for upcoming boundary-adoption changes.
