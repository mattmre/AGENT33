# Session 35: EVOKORE-MCP Setup & Status Line Integration
Date: 2026-02-22

## Summary of Work Completed
- **Created EVOKORE-MCP Repository:** Initialized a completely new, lightweight MCP router and server built on TypeScript. 
- **Extensive Skill Ingestion:** Cloned and extracted over 200+ Agent Skills, Prompt Templates, and Workflow Guides from 9 massive repositories (including `wshobson/agents`, `ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills`, `planning-with-files`, and `danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure`).
- **Architected v2 Enterprise Router:** 
  - Implemented **Semantic RAG Loading** (`fuse.js`) to completely crush context bloat. The MCP server now silently searches 200+ skills and only injects the top 3 relevant ones dynamically via the `resolve_workflow` tool.
  - Implemented **Multi-Server Proxying** via `child_process.spawn`. The server can now spin up official Anthropic execution tools (GitHub, Filesystem) and securely proxy the AI's requests to them.
  - Built a **Security Interceptor (HITL)** utilizing a `permissions.yml` and `.env` vault to ensure the AI cannot execute dangerous commands (like `github_create_pull_request`) without explicit human approval.
- **Cross-Platform Status Line:** Extracted the visual CLI status bar concept from `Personal_AI_Infrastructure` and rewrote it in pure Node.js (`scripts/status.js`) to guarantee cross-platform execution on Windows.
- **Documentation:** Automatically generated deep-dive training manuals for all 10 categories of skills, updated the `README.md`, and built the `get_skill_help` tool directly into the MCP server.

## Current Blockers & Next Steps
- The user had to step away for errands. 
- **Immediate task on return:** Ensure the user's PowerShell alias (`gemini-evokore`) is correctly executing the AI CLI followed immediately by the `status.js` UI hook so the visual token counter and skill loaded metrics appear cleanly in their terminal.
