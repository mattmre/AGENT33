# Session 45 Log
Date: 2026-02-25

## Context
- The repo had just merged Phase 27, 29, 30 components from another concurrent session. 
- The priority shifted to Phase 35 Wave 2: Multimodal Async-Governance Convergence (Priority 1 in next-session.md).

## Completed Work
1. **Multimodal Async-Governance Convergence (PR #85)**:
   - Modified `MultimodalAdapter` protocol and implementations (`STTAdapter`, `TTSAdapter`, `VisionAdapter`) to be `async def run()`.
   - Switched from synchronous `enforce_connector_governance` to asynchronous `ConnectorExecutor` via `build_connector_boundary_executor`.
   - Integrated `httpx.AsyncClient` into `_handler` coroutines for actual provider calls.
   - Updated `MultimodalService.execute_request` to await the adapters.
   - Updated `create_request` and `execute_request` API endpoints to await `_service.execute_request`.
   - Updated `engine/tests/test_multimodal_api.py` to make `test_service_policy_and_lifecycle_contracts` an `async def` since it calls `_service.execute_request` directly.
   - Verified that the full `engine` test suite (1904 tests) is passing without regressions.

## Documentation Updated
- Created `docs/research/phase35-multimodal-async-governance.md` tracking the implementation specifics and boundaries.

## Next Steps
- Review and merge PR #85.
- Update observability metrics/dashboards to ensure the new async path properly surfaces multimodal latencies and errors.
