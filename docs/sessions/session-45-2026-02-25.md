# Session 45 — Test-Hardening Validation Rerun + Packaging Prep

**Date**: 2026-02-25  
**Focus/Goal**: Capture fresh hardened smoke-gate evidence, supersede prior 332/339 drift baseline, and prepare PR packaging map for review.

## Fresh-Agent Wave Trace

- **Researcher wave**: revalidated target artifacts and extracted authoritative rerun counts from hardened smoke-gate execution.
- **Architect wave**: confirmed command-group immutability, baseline replacement rules, and historical-context retention.
- **Implementer wave**: updated review packet, research note, next-session handoff, and session evidence with new validated totals.
- **Tester wave**: executed/confirmed hardened smoke-gate batches and aggregate evidence.
- **Reviewer wave (next)**: verify count consistency and PR package mapping coverage across priorities 1–15.

## Validation Evidence (Authoritative Rerun)

- Smoke Group 1 (Phase30/31/32 + tool-loop/invoke-iterative/skill/context): **213 passed, 1 skipped**
- Smoke Group 2 (Messaging boundary + phase32): **45 passed, 1 skipped**
- Smoke Group 3 (LLM memory/performance + phase32): **40 passed, 1 skipped**
- Smoke Group 4 (Multimodal adapters/api + phase32): **46 passed, 1 skipped**
- Smoke Group 5 (Chat + phase32): **17 passed, 1 skipped**
- Aggregate: **361 passed, 5 skipped**

## Drift Reconciliation Status

- Historical drift window (**332 vs 339**) is retained in artifacts for provenance.
- Fresh hardened rerun evidence supersedes prior aggregate lock.
- Current baseline lock is now **361 passed, 5 skipped**.

## Priority 1–15 Mapping to Proposed PR Packages

| Priority | Proposed PR package | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | PR-A: Validation Snapshot Refresh | Reconfirm wave scope and package boundaries for hardening follow-up. |
| 2 | PR-A: Validation Snapshot Refresh | Lock aggregate baseline at **361/5** in snapshot artifacts. |
| 3 | PR-A: Validation Snapshot Refresh | Preserve all five smoke command groups unchanged. |
| 4 | PR-A: Validation Snapshot Refresh | Cross-check count consistency across review packet/session artifacts. |
| 5 | PR-C: Session Continuity + Audit Context | Preserve superseded **332 vs 339** historical context. |
| 6 | PR-C: Session Continuity + Audit Context | Apply session-delivery checklist and handoff controls. |
| 7 | PR-C: Session Continuity + Audit Context | Keep edits surgical and traceable. |
| 8 | PR-B: Post-Hardening Follow-up Notes | Document test-hardening linkage to validation deltas. |
| 9 | PR-A: Validation Snapshot Refresh | Keep five-group smoke requirement for boundary-touching merges. |
| 10 | PR-A: Validation Snapshot Refresh | Preserve sequencing-label policy references. |
| 11 | PR-C: Session Continuity + Audit Context | Mark evidence as newly rerun (not carried forward). |
| 12 | PR-C: Session Continuity + Audit Context | Align latest-session pointers and linked artifacts. |
| 13 | PR-D: PR Packaging Matrix | Publish explicit priority-to-package map for reviewers. |
| 14 | PR-D: PR Packaging Matrix | Add proactive deviation reporting expectations. |
| 15 | PR-D: PR Packaging Matrix | Enforce closeout block if governance/sequencing/reconciliation is missing. |

## Reviewer Notes

- Confirm every updated artifact references **361 passed, 5 skipped** consistently.
- Confirm no smoke command strings changed.
- Confirm historical drift notes remain present but clearly marked as superseded.
