# Session 25 — Phase 25 Stage 1 Implementation Orchestration

**Date**: 2026-02-17  
**Goal**: Execute top next-session priorities by merging prerequisite docs PRs, implementing Phase 25 Stage 1 (workflow DAG visualization), and preparing Phase 26 readiness artifacts  
**Branch**: `phase25-workflow-graph-mvp`  
**PR**: _pending creation_

## Summary

Completed prerequisite merges (PR #26 and PR #27), created a fresh implementation branch from updated `main`, delivered Phase 25 Stage 1 backend/frontend graph functionality, and captured Phase 26 readiness design documentation.

## Agent Orchestration Log

### 1) Researcher Agent
- Mapped current backend/frontend integration points for Phase 25.
- Identified workflow registry/history as backend data source and domain operation card architecture as frontend integration path.

### 2) Architect Agent
- Produced implementation contract for workflow graph API and UI wiring.
- Established readiness direction for Phase 26 metadata lifecycle and fact-check criteria.

### 3) Implementer Agent (Backend)
- Added visualization route and graph generation service.
- Added backend tests and workflow-history step status overlay support.

### 4) Implementer Agent (Frontend)
- Added WorkflowGraph React component and React Flow integration.
- Wired new workflows domain operation and graph rendering UX path.
- Added frontend graph mapping tests.

### 5) Documentation Agent
- Created Phase 25 progress log and Phase 26 readiness research artifact.
- Updated walkthrough and phase planning/status documentation.

## Completed Actions

1. **Merged prerequisite docs PRs**
   - Merged PR #26 (`docs: Phase 22 closure refresh and archive handoff`)
   - Merged PR #27 (`docs: add Phase 25 visual-explainer integration plan`)
2. **Branch setup**
   - Pulled latest `main`
   - Created implementation branch: `phase25-workflow-graph-mvp`
3. **Phase 25 backend MVP**
   - Added `GET /v1/visualizations/workflows/{workflow_id}/graph`
   - Added `engine/src/agent33/services/graph_generator.py`
   - Wired router in `engine/src/agent33/main.py`
   - Extended workflow history with `step_statuses` for graph status overlay
4. **Phase 25 frontend MVP**
   - Added `frontend/src/components/WorkflowGraph.tsx`
   - Added `workflow-graph` operation hint/path integration
   - Added `frontend/src/components/WorkflowGraph.test.ts`
   - Added `reactflow` dependency
5. **Phase 26 readiness docs**
   - Added `docs/research/phase26-visual-review-readiness-2026-02-17.md`

## Key Artifacts

- `engine/src/agent33/api/routes/visualizations.py`
- `engine/src/agent33/services/graph_generator.py`
- `engine/tests/test_visualizations_api.py`
- `frontend/src/components/WorkflowGraph.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/WorkflowGraph.test.ts`
- `docs/progress/phase-25-visual-explainer-log.md`
- `docs/research/phase26-visual-review-readiness-2026-02-17.md`

## Validation Evidence

### Backend
- `cd engine && python -m ruff check src tests` -> pass
- `cd engine && python -m pytest tests/test_visualizations_api.py -q` -> `12 passed`
- `cd engine && python -m pytest tests/test_workflow_scheduling_api.py -q` -> `25 passed`

### Frontend
- `cd frontend && npm install` -> pass
- `cd frontend && npm run lint` -> pass
- `cd frontend && npm run test -- --run` -> `13 passed`
- `cd frontend && npm run build` -> pass

### Note
- Full backend suite (`python -m pytest tests/ -q`) was started and partially progressed, then stopped due long runtime in-session; targeted suites for touched surfaces passed.

## Next Steps

1. Run or complete full backend suite when execution window allows.
2. Open review PR for `phase25-workflow-graph-mvp`.
3. Perform focused review on graph API response contract and frontend graph UX.
4. Begin Phase 26 implementation once Phase 25 PR is merged.
