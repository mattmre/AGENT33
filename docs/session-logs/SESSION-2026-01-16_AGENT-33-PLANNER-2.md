# Planner Cycle Log (AGENT-33)

## Date
2026-01-16

## Objective
Confirm phase status, sequencing, and orchestration roles for this session.

## Inputs Reviewed
- `docs/next session/next-session-narrative.md`
- `core/orchestrator/handoff/TASKS.md`
- `docs/phases/PHASE-03-08-WORKFLOW-PLAN.md`

## Phase Status Check
- No "Remaining: 0" tier markers found in repo.
- Phase 3-4 reviewer signoff still pending in `core/orchestrator/handoff/TASKS.md`.
- Phase 6 tasks (T11-T12) not started.

## Plan
1) Verify test suite/CI availability and record evidence.
2) Extract and sequence any "Recommended Additional Tests", "Priority Follow-ups", and "Recommended Tasks".
3) Produce role cycle logs and update verification log + next-session narrative.
