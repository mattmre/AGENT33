# Follow-up Engineer Cycle Log (AGENT-33)

## Date
2026-01-16

## Objective
Extract and sequence Recommended Additional Tests, Priority Follow-ups, and Recommended Tasks with acceptance criteria.

## Source Scan
- Command: `rg -n "Recommended Additional Tests|Priority Follow-ups|Recommended Tasks" D:\GITHUB\AGENT-33`
- Result: Matches only in collected logs and prior session logs; no current session inputs with acceptance criteria.

## Sequenced Backlog
- None found in `docs/next session/next-session-narrative.md` or current handoff docs.

## Unblock Plan
- Provide source docs containing explicit "Recommended Additional Tests", "Priority Follow-ups", or "Recommended Tasks" sections with acceptance criteria.
