# Planner Cycle Log (AGENT-33)

## Date
2026-01-16

## Objective
Establish session plan, phase status, and execution ordering.

## Inputs Reviewed
- `docs/next session/next-session-narrative.md`
- `core/orchestrator/handoff/TASKS.md`
- `docs/phases/PHASE-03-SPEC-FIRST-ORCHESTRATION-WORKFLOW.md`
- `docs/phases/PHASE-04-AGENT-HARNESS-AND-RUNTIME.md`

## Phase Status Check
- No "Remaining: 0" tier markers found in repo.
- Current phase work still active: review workflow integration and Phase 3-4 evidence confirmation.

## Plan
1) Verify test suite availability + repo state.
2) Extract recommended tests/follow-ups/tasks into a sequenced backlog.
3) Integrate review workflow links and checklist updates.
4) Record verification evidence + session logs; update next-session narrative.

## Notes
- Phase 3-4 tasks show review pending; integration items remain before moving to Phase 5 priorities.
