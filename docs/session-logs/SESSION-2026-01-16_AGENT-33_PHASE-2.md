# Session Log: Phase 2 Canonical Core Architecture

## Date
2026-01-16

## Objectives
- Document completion of Phase 2 acceptance criteria.
- Link canonicalization evidence and references.

## Acceptance Criteria Status
- [x] Every promoted file lists sources and rationale.
  - Evidence: `core/CHANGELOG.md` canonicalization table entries.
- [x] Core layout is documented and referenced from indexes.
  - Evidence: `core/README.md`, `core/INDEX.md`, `docs/phase-planning.md`.
- [x] No content changes in `collected/`.
  - Evidence: No session logs or changelog entries record edits to `collected/`.

## Work Completed
- Canonicalization decisions logged with sources and rationales.
- Core structure and indexes reference canonical assets and phase plans.

## Evidence (Files)
- `core/CHANGELOG.md`
- `core/README.md`
- `core/INDEX.md`
- `docs/phase-planning.md`

## Notes
- Phase 2 relies on canonicalization logs rather than code-level tests.
- Evidence capture template: `core/orchestrator/handoff/EVIDENCE_CAPTURE.md`.
