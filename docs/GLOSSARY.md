# Glossary

Terminology used throughout AGENT-33 documentation and specifications.

## Core Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Agent** | An autonomous unit with a defined role, system prompt, model assignment, and input/output schema. Agents are the building blocks of workflows. |
| **Workflow** | A directed acyclic graph (DAG) of steps that execute in dependency order. Workflows orchestrate multiple agents and actions to accomplish complex tasks. |
| **Orchestrator** | The top-level agent responsible for decomposing tasks, assigning work to agents, and managing handoffs. Defined in `core/orchestrator/`. |
| **Worker** | An agent that executes a specific task assigned by the orchestrator. Workers have focused capabilities and defined boundaries. |
| **Reviewer** | An agent that evaluates outputs from workers for quality, accuracy, and compliance with governance rules. |
| **Step** | A single unit of work within a workflow. Each step has an action type, inputs, outputs, and optional dependencies on other steps. |
| **Action** | The operation performed by a workflow step: `invoke_agent`, `run_command`, `transform`, `validate`, `conditional`, `parallel_group`, or `wait`. |
| **Context** | The assembled information passed to an agent or LLM: system prompt, conversation history, RAG results, and tool outputs. |
| **Handoff** | The transfer of work from one agent to another, including the context and expectations for the receiving agent. |
| **Checkpoint** | A persisted snapshot of workflow state at a given step, enabling resume after failure. Stored in PostgreSQL. |
| **Session** | A stateful conversation or workflow execution with its own memory, context window, and encryption scope. |
| **Tool** | An external capability available to agents: shell commands, file operations, web fetching, or browser automation. |
| **Governance** | The set of policies, allowlists, budgets, and review protocols that constrain agent behavior. |

## Technical Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **pgvector** | PostgreSQL extension for vector similarity search. Used for embedding storage and RAG retrieval. |
| **JetStream** | NATS persistence layer providing at-least-once delivery for the internal message bus. |
| **AES-256-GCM** | Symmetric encryption algorithm used for data at rest. Provides both confidentiality and integrity. |
| **JWT** | JSON Web Token — used for authenticating API requests. Signed with HMAC-SHA256 by default. |
| **RBAC** | Role-Based Access Control — permissions system where users have roles and roles have scopes. |
| **RAG** | Retrieval-Augmented Generation — augments LLM prompts with relevant documents retrieved by semantic similarity. |
| **Embedding** | A dense vector representation of text used for similarity search. Generated by Ollama or OpenAI embedding models. |
| **Prompt Injection** | An attack where malicious input attempts to override the system prompt. AGENT-33 includes detection and sanitization. |
| **Observability** | The ability to understand system behavior through logs, metrics, traces, and lineage records. |
| **Lineage** | A record of data flow through the system: which inputs produced which outputs, through which agents and steps. |
| **Dead-Letter Queue** | A queue for messages or webhook deliveries that failed after all retry attempts. Stored for manual inspection. |

## Framework Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Phase** | A numbered stage of AGENT-33 development (Phase 1-20), each adding a specific capability area. See [Phase History](phases/). |
| **Spec** | A specification document in `core/` that defines expected behavior, protocols, or architecture patterns. |
| **Evidence** | Artifacts that prove a claim: test results, execution logs, benchmark data, review records. |
| **Regression Gate** | An automated check that prevents changes from degrading existing capabilities. Defined in `core/arch/REGRESSION_GATES.md`. |
| **ARCH-AEP** | Architecture Evolution Proposal — a formal process for proposing changes to core specifications. |
| **Autonomy Budget** | A configurable limit on the scope and cost of actions an agent can take without human approval. |
