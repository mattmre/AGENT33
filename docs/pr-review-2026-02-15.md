# PR Review - February 15, 2026

Scope:
- Reviewed all currently visible PRs for `mattmre/AGENT33`: `#1` through `#12`.
- Source: GitHub PR metadata and changed-file summaries.

## Findings (Highest Priority First)

1. Documentation drift is substantial between merged runtime behavior and existing top-level docs.
   - Merged PRs `#2` to `#6` materially changed security, memory, review/release/evaluation/autonomy surfaces, but setup and API docs still reflected earlier paths and assumptions.
2. Open PRs `#7` to `#12` introduce major capabilities that are not yet on `main`.
   - Documentation must clearly separate "current" vs "proposed" features to avoid operational mismatches.
3. Auth and bootstrapping constraints are under-documented.
   - Token issuance path exists (`/v1/auth/token`) but depends on in-memory user seeding.
4. Several modules are intentionally in-memory and reset on restart.
   - This persistence boundary was not consistently documented.

## PR-by-PR Assessment

| PR | Status | Date | Summary | Documentation Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1 | Closed (not merged) | Created 2026-02-03 | Observatory dashboard/platform overhaul proposal | Do not treat as current runtime baseline |
| #2 | Merged | Merged 2026-02-14 | Trivy CI scan, CORS tightening, auth middleware path fixes | Security/setup docs must include exact middleware behavior |
| #3 | Merged | Merged 2026-02-14 | HTTP pooling and embedding batching | Setup/performance docs should reflect batch embedding path |
| #4 | Merged | Merged 2026-02-14 | Governance and progressive recall wiring into agent prompts | Agent behavior docs must include governance/recall injection |
| #5 | Merged | Merged 2026-02-14 | Scope-based authorization enforcement + auth hardening | API docs must include scope requirements per endpoint |
| #6 | Merged | Merged 2026-02-14 | ZeroClaw parity items 13-19 + integration wiring | Core functionality docs must cover review/eval/release/autonomy/improvement systems |
| #7 | Open | Updated 2026-02-15 | Iterative tool-use loop (`invoke_iterative`) | Mark as pending; do not present as live API on `main` |
| #8 | Open | Updated 2026-02-15 | 4-stage hybrid skill matching | Mark as pending skill pipeline enhancement |
| #9 | Open | Updated 2026-02-15 | Context window management | Mark as pending context management layer |
| #10 | Open | Updated 2026-02-15 | Agent World Model research/roadmap doc | Reference as research-only pending merge |
| #11 | Open | Updated 2026-02-15 | Doc processing + new workflow actions (`http-request`, `sub-workflow`, `route`) | Mark as pending workflow action expansion |
| #12 | Open | Updated 2026-02-15 | BM25 warmup + memory ingest endpoint | Mark as pending ingest/warmup capability |

## Decisions Applied in This Documentation Refresh

- Treat `main` runtime behavior as canonical.
- Track open PR capabilities in a "pending" section only.
- Add explicit scope/auth mapping and persistence boundary documentation.
- Add setup and walkthrough docs that only use currently available endpoints.

## Follow-up Recommendations

1. When PRs `#7` to `#12` merge, update:
   - `docs/functionality-and-workflows.md`
   - `docs/api-surface.md`
   - `docs/walkthroughs.md`
2. Add a changelog-driven doc check in CI to prevent future drift.
3. Add a dedicated "bootstrap users" mechanism to remove current auth setup friction.
