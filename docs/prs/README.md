# Phase 22 PR Checkpoints

These checkpoint docs split Phase 22 into reviewable PR-sized slices.

## Checkpoints
- `phase-22-pr-01-platform-foundation.md`
- `phase-22-pr-02-frontend-control-plane.md`
- `phase-22-pr-03-wiring-and-verification.md`

## Notes
- These are PR-ready summaries and validation artifacts captured in-repo.
- If a remote Git host is configured, use these as commit/PR descriptions.
