# AGENT-33 Phase Index

This index lists the AGENT-33 development phases. Each phase file is a single-phase plan using the same structure as the generic templates in `core/phases/`.

## Workflow Plans
- `PHASE-03-08-WORKFLOW-PLAN.md` (phase sequencing, task mapping, review gates)
- `PHASE-11-20-WORKFLOW-PLAN.md` (extended sequencing and task mapping)
- `PHASE-21-24-WORKFLOW-PLAN.md` (post-core product/access sequencing)

## Notes
- Generic templates live in `core/phases/` and serve as structural examples.
- This index is the canonical plan for AGENT-33 execution sequencing.
