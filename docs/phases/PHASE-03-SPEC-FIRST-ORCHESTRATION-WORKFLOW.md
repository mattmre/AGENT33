# Phase 03: Spec-First Orchestration Workflow

## Overview
- **Phase**: 03 of 10
- **Category**: Orchestration
- **Release Target**: TBD
- **Estimated Sprints**: TBD

## Objectives
- Standardize spec-first workflow artifacts (PLAN/TASKS/STATUS/DECISIONS/PRIORITIES).
- Align orchestration templates with evidence-first execution.
- Define acceptance checks and autonomy budgets for agent tasks.

## Scope Outline
- Planning: confirm requirements, inputs/outputs, and success metrics.
- Implementation: build minimal, composable components and integration seams.
- Validation: create deterministic checks and evidence.
- Documentation: add concise usage notes and examples.

## Deliverables
- Updated orchestration templates and guidance.
- Spec-first workflow checklist and sample plan.
- Autonomy budget guidelines and escalation criteria.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Spec-first workflow is documented and referenced in handoff docs.
- [ ] Sample spec includes goals, non-goals, assumptions, and acceptance checks.
- [ ] Autonomy budget includes scope, command allowlist, and stop conditions.

## Dependencies
- Phase 02

## Blocks
- Phase 04

## Orchestration Guidance
- Architect agent reviews workflow alignment with research trends.
- QA agent verifies evidence capture sections are explicit.
- Log decisions for any template changes.

## Coding Direction
- Keep templates model-agnostic.
- Prefer checklists over narrative blocks.
- Ensure all workflow docs cross-link correctly.

## Review Checklist
- [ ] Interfaces/contracts reviewed and approved.
- [ ] Tests/fixtures or evidence added.
- [ ] Documentation updated and verified.
- [ ] Scope remains within this phase only.
