# POST-P72 Phase Plan (2026)

**Status**: Approved in Session 122, restored in Session 124, synced to merged baseline through `#404` on 2026-04-15, execution posture updated in Session 127
**Scope**: POST-1 through POST-4 plus post-cluster distribution work

## Purpose

This file is the canonical roadmap for the post-P72 wave. It captures what is already merged on `main`, what remains queued, and which slices should resume next from fresh `origin/main` worktrees.

## Current Status Snapshot

| Cluster | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST-1 — Foundation & Baseline | Complete | PRs `#384`-`#387` |
| POST-2 — SkillsBench Competitiveness | Complete | PRs `#388`-`#392` |
| POST-3 — Pack Ecosystem | Complete | PRs `#394`, `#395`, `#397`, `#398` (`#393` / `#396` were docs reconciliation and wrap) |
| POST-4 — Interruption & Self-Improvement | Complete | `POST-4.1`-`POST-4.5` complete in PRs `#399`-`#406` |
| POST-CLUSTER — Distribution & Ecosystem Growth | Active | Public launch preparation is the current slice |

## Current Execution Queue

| Order | Slice | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | POST-CLUSTER — Public launch preparation | Active | Root README product page plus onboarding/getting-started/release-readiness docs |
| 2 | POST-CLUSTER — P-ENV v2 auto-install + automated model download | Pending | Starts after launch-prep docs land |
| 3 | POST-CLUSTER — Pack marketplace web UI | Pending | Starts after P-ENV v2 |
| 4 | POST-CLUSTER — Community submissions | Pending | Only after pack signing + approval queue are proven |

## Parallel Follow-up Work During POST-4 Execution

- Verify P68-Lite monitoring remains healthy (`outcomes` table not empty during rollout)
- Reconcile P69b persistence design intent versus the current in-memory implementation
- Document the future SSE schema upgrade path before any version 2 work begins

## Cluster Plans

- POST-1.4 — SHA-256 timing oracle fix using `hmac.compare_digest()`
- POST-1.5 — SkillsBench baseline CLI/reporting
- Exit gate: Loop 7 remediations merged; planning docs current; SkillsBench baseline committed to `benchmarks`
- Delivered by PRs `#384`-`#387`

### POST-2 — SkillsBench Competitiveness (Complete)

- POST-2.1a — SkillsBench smoke suite CI (every PR, mocked LLM, <=15 tasks)
- POST-2.1b — SkillsBench full run (weekly, live LLM, `benchmarks` branch)
- POST-2.2 — Context window management for evaluation harness
- POST-2.3 — Iterative tool-use loop + 4-stage skill matching
- ARCH-AEP Loop 8 review + remediations
- Exit gate: code complete; confirm first weekly benchmark data against baseline
- Delivered by PRs `#388`-`#392`

### POST-3 — Pack Ecosystem (Complete)

- POST-3.1 — Pack sandbox + injection tests (PR `#394`)
- POST-3.2 — Pack registry v1 revocation + Sigstore verification (PR `#395`)
- POST-3.3 — CLI DX improvements (`--json`, `--plain`, pack-aware `diagnose`) (PR `#397`)
- POST-3.4 — 5 seed packs (PR `#398`)
- Exit gate: live registry support, installable seed packs, and pack-signing enforcement landed on `main`

### POST-4 — Interruption & Self-Improvement (Complete)

- POST-4.1 — P69b UX spec + API contract document (**complete** in PR `#399`)
- POST-4.2 — SSE event schema versioning, strict rejection model (**complete** in PR `#400`)
- POST-4.3 — P69b implementation (**complete** in PR `#401`)
- POST-4.4 — P-PACK v3 A/B harness (**complete** in PR `#405`)
- POST-4.5 — P-PACK v3 behavior modifications (**complete** in PR `#406`)
- Completion criteria: P69b end-to-end tested; P-PACK v3 behavioral A/B tests passing; both behind feature flags

### POST-CLUSTER — Distribution & Ecosystem Growth (Active)

- Public launch preparation (README as product page, onboarding/getting-started/release-checklist docs) (**active**)
- P-ENV v2 auto-install + automated model download
- Pack marketplace web UI
- Community submissions (only after pack signing + approval queue proven)

## Locked Architectural Decisions (Session 122)

These decisions are final and must not be reopened without explicit user approval:

1. **SkillsBench framing**: Two-tier — smoke (every PR, mocked, <=15 tasks) + full (weekly, live, `benchmarks` branch)
2. **P69b pause state**: `PausedInvocation` state record in the state machine — not a mutable in-memory flag
3. **Pack registry v1**: GitHub JSON index — no custom hosted API
4. **Pack signing**: Sigstore cosign (keyless) — SHA-256 remains integrity only
5. **Pack sandbox**: Reuse `CLIAdapter` subprocess isolation — injection scanner is the correct defense layer
6. **P-PACK v3 rollout policy**: no calendar/data gate; implement the purpose-built A/B harness now, then use it for validation and monitoring
7. **Headless P69b**: `AGENT33_HEADLESS_TOOL_APPROVAL=approve|deny`, default `deny`
8. **SHA-256 timing oracle**: Replace direct digest comparisons with `hmac.compare_digest()`
9. **P69b replay protection**: HMAC nonce = `HMAC-SHA256(run_id + tool_name + floor(timestamp/30), tenant_secret)`
10. **SSE version enforcement**: Strict rejection — v1 clients reject v2 streams entirely
11. **A/B harness statistics**: 95% confidence, n>=30, -5% threshold, Bonferroni correction
12. **Benchmark results**: `benchmarks` branch (not `main`) — bot commits, signed
13. **Feature flag lifecycle**: Every flag ships with lifecycle metadata and a file-based kill switch
14. **Pack revocation**: Registry JSON includes `revoked`; install checks revocation
15. **P68-Lite monitoring**: Alert if outcomes table stays empty for >24h during rollout
16. **SkillsBench regression alert**: Auto-open a GitHub issue if a weekly run shows >5% drop

## Execution Rules

1. Use one fresh worktree per slice from updated `origin/main`.
2. Use one fresh research pass per slice and dispose of it after merge.
3. Open one PR per slice.
4. Do not start a later slice before the current one is merged and verified from fresh `origin/main`.
5. If research changes roadmap assumptions, write a memo under `docs/research/` before implementation.
6. Always refresh `docs/next-session.md`, this file, `docs/sessions/session126-task-plan.md`, `progress.md`, and any active queue docs after major milestones.
