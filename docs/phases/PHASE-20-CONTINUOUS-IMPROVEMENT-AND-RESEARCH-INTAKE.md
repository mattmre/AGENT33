# Phase 20: Continuous Improvement & Research Intake

## Overview
- **Phase**: 20 of 20
- **Category**: Research
- **Release Target**: TBD
- **Estimated Sprints**: TBD

## Objectives
- Establish research intake and periodic roadmap refresh.
- Capture lessons learned and update governance artifacts.
- Maintain a continuous improvement cadence.

## Scope Outline
- Planning: confirm requirements, inputs/outputs, and success metrics.
- Implementation: build minimal, composable components and integration seams.
- Validation: create deterministic checks and evidence.
- Documentation: add concise usage notes and examples.

## Deliverables
- Research intake template and tracking log.
- Roadmap refresh cadence and ownership.
- Continuous improvement checklist and change log.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Intake template exists and is referenced from planning docs.
- [x] Roadmap refresh cadence is documented.
- [x] Lessons learned are recorded in a consistent location.

## Key Artifacts
- `core/orchestrator/CONTINUOUS_IMPROVEMENT.md` - Research intake, roadmap refresh, continuous improvement

## Dependencies
- Phase 19

## Blocks
- None

## Orchestration Guidance
- Research agent curates new inputs.
- Orchestrator updates priorities based on evidence.
- Reviewer validates changes to governance artifacts.

## Coding Direction
- Keep research summaries concise and actionable.
- Prefer structured templates over narrative.
- Update only when evidence supports changes.

## Review Checklist
- [ ] Interfaces/contracts reviewed and approved.
- [ ] Tests/fixtures or evidence added.
- [ ] Documentation updated and verified.
- [ ] Scope remains within this phase only.
