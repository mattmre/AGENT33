# Repo Dossier: Multi-Agent RL Survey (arXiv:2602.11865)

**Snapshot date:** 2026-02-14

**Status:** Requires re-generation with web access. The researcher agent could not access the source material. The arXiv ID 2602.11865 corresponds to a February 2026 publication, which is after the agent's training knowledge cutoff. The agent identified the following AGENT-33 mapping points from codebase analysis:

- Current training is single-agent (per-agent optimization) with no multi-agent coordination signals
- Reward is LLM-as-judge only, no team/workflow-level reward decomposition
- No credit assignment across agents in a workflow
- No communication learning between agents
- No cooperative vs competitive dynamics modeling
