# Research — Self-Directed Analysis

AGENT-33 conducts research autonomously using structured templates and stores results in engine memory.

## Templates

Templates define the structure for generated research artifacts:

- `templates/REPO_DOSSIER_TEMPLATE.md` — Structured repository analysis format
- `templates/FEATURE_MATRIX_SCHEMA.md` — Cross-repo feature comparison schema

## Generated Output

Research outputs are generated on demand and stored in:

| Output | Location |
|--------|----------|
| Repo dossiers | `repo_dossiers/` (generated by intake) |
| Feature matrices | Engine memory (generated from dossiers) |
| Trend analyses | Engine memory (generated by `agent33 analyze --trends`) |

## Adding New Templates

1. Create a new `.md` file in `templates/` with clear field definitions
2. Register the template in the intake protocol if it should be auto-populated
3. Add validation rules to the testing protocol

See `docs/self-improvement/intake-protocol.md` for how templates are used during intake.
