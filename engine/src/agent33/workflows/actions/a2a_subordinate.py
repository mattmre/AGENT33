"""A2A Subordinate mechanism for deploying isolated trial-and-error workers.

To conserve local GPU VRAM on the primary orchestrator, highly repetitive
or trial-and-error tasks can be delegated to "subordinate" agents. These
subordinates are explicitly engineered to run via lightweight external APIs
(like OpenAI or Gemini via LiteLLM) within securely isolated Docker containers,
preventing them from polluting the main system constraints or Context Ledger.
