# Collected Projects

This directory contains reference architecture projects collected as a corpus for AGENT-33's design patterns, workflow analysis, and architectural research.

Each subdirectory represents a standalone project whose structure, conventions, and patterns inform AGENT-33's agent design and automation capabilities.

## Purpose

- Serve as reference implementations for architectural analysis
- Provide real-world examples of project structures, CI/CD patterns, and coding conventions
- Support AGENT-33's ability to understand and work with diverse codebases
