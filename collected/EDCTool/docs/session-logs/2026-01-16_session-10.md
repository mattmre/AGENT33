# Session Log: 2026-01-16 (Session 10)

**Duration**: ~45 minutes
**Focus**: Sequenced Backlog Execution - PRs Rebasing and Merging
**Branch**: `master`

---

## Summary

Executed the sequenced backlog extracted from next-session-narrative.md. Successfully rebased and merged all 6 blocked PRs (#87-92). Fixed xUnit2013 warnings. Test count increased from 432 to 574 tests.

---

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. All Blocked PRs Rebased and Merged

| PR | Title | Status | Commits Added |
|----|-------|--------|---------------|
| #87 | fix(security): Remove hardcoded database credentials | MERGED | 2 |
| #88 | fix: HIGH tier quick wins | MERGED | 1 |
| #89 | test(HIGH): Integration tests and DatFile tests | MERGED | 1 |
| #90 | feat: 113 tests, dead code, wire menu handlers | MERGED | 2 |
| #91 | fix(MEDIUM): Security, reliability, docs | MERGED | 1 |
| #92 | fix(MEDIUM): Debug output and UX validation | MERGED | 3 |

**Root Cause of CI Failures**: PRs were created before PR #93 (CI fix) was merged. The workflow YAML had a PowerShell syntax error in the security scan step. Rebasing on master inherited the fixed workflow.

### 2. Test Count Increased Significantly

- **Before**: 432 tests
- **After**: 574 tests (+142 tests from merged PRs)
- **Status**: ALL PASSING

### 3. xUnit2013 Warnings Fixed

Fixed 2 instances of xUnit2013 warnings:
- `ColumnOperationsServiceTests.cs:54` - Changed `Assert.Equal(1, dt.Columns.Count)` to `Assert.Single(dt.Columns)`
- `PresenterServiceIntegrationTests.cs:418` - Same pattern fixed

### 4. Conflict Resolution

**PR #87** had a conflict in `app.config` between:
- Master: Template with placeholder credentials (`YOUR_SERVER`, `YOUR_PASSWORD`)
- PR: Comment directing to security guide

Resolved by taking the PR version (cleaner security guidance).

**PR #90** and **PR #92** had documentation conflicts in `docs/refinement-remediation/2026-01-15_tracker.md` and `CLAUDE.md`. Resolved by taking the PR versions (more current status).

## Agentic Orchestration

### Agents Used
1. **Researcher Agent** - Launched to audit test coverage gaps (background)
2. **Todo Tracker** - Managed 8-item backlog throughout session

### Parallel Operations
- PR status checks run in parallel with test execution
- Multiple PR merges batched where possible

## Technical Notes

### Rebase Strategy
For each blocked PR:
1. `gh pr checkout <n>`
2. `git stash` (to handle settings.local.json changes)
3. `git rebase master`
4. Resolve any conflicts
5. `git push --force-with-lease`
6. Wait for CI to pass
7. `gh pr merge <n> --squash --delete-branch`

### Settings File Issue
`.claude/settings.local.json` kept getting modified during the session (Claude Code adding permissions). Used `git update-index --assume-unchanged` and `git stash` to work around.
